<h2>📚 Featured Articles – April 2025</h2>

<h3>🔍 1. Schrems II vs. Cloudflare: Are You Still at Risk in 2025?</h3>
<p>We dive into the legal aftershocks of Schrems II, and how many EU websites still unknowingly violate the GDPR by routing traffic through U.S.-based services like Cloudflare. Learn why this matters, how to detect it, and the steps needed to localize routing using EU-based CDN or DNS tools.</p>

<h3>📊 2. Ditching Google Analytics — Legally</h3>
<p>Google Analytics is still under fire from multiple EU regulators. We break down why, and offer GDPR-safe replacements like Matomo, Plausible, and Simple Analytics. Includes a mini-guide for updating your privacy policy and running a DPIA to stay compliant when switching tools.</p>

<h3>🌐 3. DNS Is a Compliance Layer</h3>
<p>Most privacy teams overlook DNS — but it's often the first place user data leaks cross-border. We explain the role of DNSSEC, GeoDNS, and how 45dgof8’s DNS-Manager-GPT enables legal, region-bound routing. Plus: what to ask your DNS provider before your next audit.</p>

<h3>📄 4. DPIA Template: The Legal Fire Extinguisher</h3>
<p>Every privacy-sensitive app needs a DPIA. We provide a starter checklist to help assess high-risk processing activities (AI profiling, biometrics, third-country transfers). Ideal for developers, product teams, and DPOs needing a fast, GDPR-grounded workflow.</p>
