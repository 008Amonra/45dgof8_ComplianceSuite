# 45dgof8_compliance_gpt
Streamlit app for compliance guidance. 45dgof8 Compliance GPT Prototype Description This is a Streamlit-based prototype for the 45dgof8 Compliance GPT system. It demonstrates how user queries can be routed dynamically between lightweight and 
high-capacity GPT models based on their intent and complexity. The app is designed for compliance-related tasks, smalltalk, and casual interaction
Features
Dynamic Query Routing:
Lightweight GPT-3.5 model for smalltalk and casual conversations.
High-capacity GPT-4 model for compliance and domain-specific queries.
User-Friendly Interface:
Simple input box for queries.
Clear and actionable responses tailored to user needs.
Streamlit Framework:
Easy to deploy and extend.
How It Works
Users type a query into the input box.
The app evaluates the query’s intent:
Smalltalk queries (e.g., “Hello!”) are routed to a lightweight GPT.
Compliance-specific queries (e.g., “What are the principles of GDPR?”) are routed to a high-capacity GPT.
Unknown or complex queries default to the high-capacity GPT.
The appropriate GPT model processes the query, and the response is displayed to the user.
