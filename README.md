## 🔧 Project: 45dgof8_Compliance_GPT

**Streamlit app for compliance guidance.**

This is a prototype for a compliance-focused GPT system that dynamically routes queries between lightweight and high-capacity models, depending on the user's intent and complexity of the request.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔄 Dynamic Query Routing:
- **Lightweight GPT-3.5** model for smalltalk and casual conversations
- **High-capacity GPT-4** model for compliance and domain-specific queries

### 🖥 User Interface:
- Simple input box for questions
- Clear and actionable responses

### ⚙️ Powered by Streamlit:
- Easy to deploy, customize, and extend

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User types a query.
2. App analyzes the query's **intent**:
   - “Hi there!” → routed to GPT-3.5 (casual)
   - “What are GDPR’s 7 principles?” → routed to GPT-4 (expert mode)
   - Unclear? Defaults to high-capacity GPT
3. The system responds with tailored output

## 🧰 Coming Soon

- Modular GPT assistants for specific regions
- DNS manager and compliance dashboard
- Creative GPT showcase portal (🌟 via `creative_part.html`)
