<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 1, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you interact with tools and services on <a href="https://45dgof8.com">45dgof8.com</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
<p>We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information. All interactions are processed in real time and are not retained after the session ends.</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Some tools may use third-party APIs, such as those from OpenAI, to generate responses. These services may have their own privacy practices. We do not control or store any data passed through these services.</p>

<h2>4. Transparency and Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about how data is handled during your visit, please contact us at <a href="mailto:45dgof8@gmail.com">45dgof8@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2>5. Updates</h2>
<p>This policy may be revised occasionally. Please refer to this page for the latest version.</p>

<h2>6. Payments and Financial Contributions</h2>
<p>We offer both voluntary contributions and paid services through PayPal and 45dgof8-pulse.</p>

<p><strong>PayPal:</strong> When making a donation or purchase via PayPal, you are redirected to PayPal’s platform, where your information (such as name, email, and payment details) is processed securely. We do not store or handle this payment data. For details, please consult PayPal’s <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>45dgof8-pulse:</strong> Payments and invoicing may also be handled through 45dgof8-pulse, a trusted infrastructure that may utilize third-party services (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, bank transfer) to process transactions. While we do not collect or store sensitive payment data, we may retain minimal metadata (such as invoice IDs or payment confirmation) necessary for service fulfillment and documentation.</p>

<p>All financial transactions — whether for services or voluntary support — are used solely to maintain, improve, or deliver project offerings. We do not market or resell contributor or client data under any circumstances.</p>
