<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 1, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you interact with tools and services on <a href="https://45dgof8.com">45dgof8.com</a>.</p>
<p>This website is operated by a private individual based in Switzerland. It is not operated by a registered business in Japan or any other jurisdiction. Services are offered globally on a private, non-corporate basis.</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
<p>We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII). All interactions are processed in real time and are not retained after the session ends. We do not use cookies, analytics, or behavioral tracking tools.</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Some tools on this site use third-party APIs (e.g., OpenAI) to generate responses. These services may process data on servers located outside your country, including in the United States. We do not control or retain any data passed through these services. Please refer to the respective provider’s privacy policy for their data handling practices.</p>

<h2>4. Cross-Border Data Awareness</h2>
<p>Interactions may involve data transmission through third-party systems located outside your country of residence. This includes jurisdictions such as the United States (OpenAI), even though 45dgof8.com itself does not store any user data. Users accessing from regions such as Japan (APPI), the EU (GDPR), or Canada (PIPEDA) are advised of this cross-border flow.</p>

<h2>5. Transparency and Contact</h2>
<p>For questions or concerns about data handling, please contact us at <a href="mailto:45dgof8@gmail.com">45dgof8@gmail.com</a>. We respond within 3–5 business days.</p>

<h2>6. Payments and Financial Contributions</h2>
<p>We offer both voluntary contributions and paid services through PayPal and 45dgof8-pulse.</p>

<p><strong>PayPal:</strong> When making a payment via PayPal, you are redirected to PayPal’s secure platform, where your data (e.g., name, email, and payment method) is processed in accordance with PayPal’s <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not access or store this data.</p>

<p><strong>45dgof8-pulse:</strong> Payments and invoicing may also be handled via 45dgof8-pulse, which may use third-party payment systems (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or bank transfer). We do not collect sensitive payment data, but we may retain minimal metadata (such as invoice IDs or confirmation numbers) solely for service delivery and documentation.</p>

<p>All financial data is used only for maintaining or improving services. We do not market, sell, or resell any client or contributor data under any circumstances.</p>

<h2>7. Jurisdiction-Specific Notes</h2>
<p><strong>Switzerland (FADP):</strong> This service is operated under Swiss privacy principles. No PII is stored or reused.</p>
<p><strong>Japan (APPI):</strong> This is not a Japanese legal entity. By using the service, you acknowledge that data may be processed outside Japan. We comply with APPI's transparency expectations. このサービスはスイスの個人によって運営されています。日本における法人ではありません。</p>
<p><strong>United States:</strong> Some third-party tools used may process data on U.S.-based servers (e.g., OpenAI). This site itself does not store data or operate commercial functions in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>EU (GDPR):</strong> While we do not collect or store personal data, users in the EU are advised that any session data may temporarily pass through processors based outside the EU. We honor GDPR principles of transparency and minimal data use.</p>

<h2>8. Updates</h2>
<p>This policy may be revised occasionally. Please refer to this page for the latest version. Previous versions are archived privately for recordkeeping.</p>
