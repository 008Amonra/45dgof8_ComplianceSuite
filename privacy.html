<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 1, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you interact with tools and services on <a href="https://45dgof8.com">45dgof8.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information. All interactions are processed in real time and are not retained after the session ends.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Some tools may use third-party APIs, such as those from OpenAI, to generate responses. These services may have their own privacy practices. We do not control or store any data passed through these services.</p>

  <h2>4. Transparency and Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about how data is handled during your visit, please contact us at <a href="mailto:45dgof8@gmail.com">45dgof8@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>5. Updates</h2>
  <p>This policy may be revised occasionally. Please refer to this page for the latest version.</p>

<h2>Payments and Financial Contributions</h2>
<p>To support our work, we offer donation and payment options via PayPal and the 45dgof8-pulse service.</p>

<p><strong>PayPal:</strong> When you donate via PayPal, you are redirected to PayPal’s platform, where your information (such as name, email, and payment details) is processed securely by PayPal. We do not store or handle any of this payment data. Please refer to PayPal’s <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>45dgof8-pulse:</strong> Payments and invoices may also be processed through our payment infrastructure called 45dgof8-pulse. This system may use third-party payment rails (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, bank transfer, etc.) to complete transactions. We do not directly collect or store sensitive financial information; however, metadata (such as transaction IDs or status) may be recorded to ensure service delivery and receipts.</p>

<p>All payment interactions are voluntary and used solely to support project maintenance and service enhancements. No marketing or resale of contributor data will occur.</p>
